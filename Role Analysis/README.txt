This folder includes the following items:

1. Java source files for a TinyAda parsing shell, including a partially completed parser module (Parser.java).

2. Byte code files for the parsing shell, including a completed parser module.

Running the programs requires the JRE for Java 6.0 or later versions.
Modifying the code requires the JDK 6.0 or later versions.

With the GUI app, you can open a test file and separately test the chario, scanner, and parser classes using command buttons.  You can also edit the file and save it.  Finally, you can enter a test file from scratch.

The only file to edit and complie is Parser.java.  If you are using a terminal window, you compile this file using the command

javac Parser.java

You can run the program using the command

java GUIApp

or

java TerminalApp

Note that you can run either of these commands immediately to try out the parser, but you will have to edit and recompile the Parser.java file to complete the exercise.
